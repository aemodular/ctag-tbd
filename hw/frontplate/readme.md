# CTAG TBD Frontpanel Design Files

You can use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) in combination with the Inkscape plugin [svg2shenzen](https://github.com/badgeek/svg2shenzhen)
to generate [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) Gerber files, which can be produced at a board house.

An .svg template is included in this folder as well as ready-made Gerber files.
